# The sub-daily P model with the new soil moisture stress function to simulate the monthly global NEE.

Code to reproduce the work by Mengoli et al. planned to be submitted to Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 

P model (Wang et al., 2017; Stocker et al., 2020) at sub-daily timescale (Mengoli et al., 2022). Repository: P-model_subDaily and also at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8018599

Sub-daily P model with the new stress function (Mengoli et al., 2023: https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1261). Repository: P-model_new_water_stress_function and also under the repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8018299
